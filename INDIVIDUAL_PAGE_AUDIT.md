## ❌ GAPS - Master Prompt Compliance

### 1. **Missing Hero → Stakes → Services → Process → Proof → FAQ → Final CTA Structure**
- **Current:** Hero → Features → Testimonials → Pricing → FAQ → CTA
- **Required:** Must add explicit "Stakes" section showing cost of inaction
- **Required:** Must add "Process" section showing how it works (steps 1-2-3)

### 2. **Weak Stakes/Problem Agitation**
- **Current:** Generic "stress and anxiety" language
- **Required:** Specific, visceral pain points:
  - "Waking up at 3am with racing thoughts?"
  - "Snapping at loved ones over small things?"
  - "Feeling like you're one crisis away from breaking?"
  - "Spending $200+/week on therapy with no clear progress?"

### 3. **Missing Direct-Response Psychology**
- **Current:** Feature-focused copy
- **Required:** Outcome-first, benefit-driven copy following PAS framework:
  - **Problem:** Specific emotional pain
  - **Agitate:** Cost of doing nothing (relationships, health, money)
  - **Solve:** Transformation promise with timeline

### 4. **Insufficient Social Proof**
- **Current:** 3 testimonials (good start)
- **Required:** Add:
  - Number of lives transformed ("Join 10,000+ people...")
  - Before/After emotional states
  - Specific timeframes ("In just 30 days...")
  - Video testimonials (if available)

### 5. **Weak Risk Reversal**
- **Current:** "30-Day Money-Back" mentioned briefly
- **Required:** Dedicated guarantee section with:
  - Bold headline: "Our 90-Day 'Feel Better or Pay Nothing' Guarantee"
  - Specific promise: "If you don't feel measurably calmer and more resilient in 90 days, we'll refund every penny—no questions asked"
  - Visual guarantee badge

### 6. **Missing Urgency/Scarcity**
- **Current:** No urgency elements
- **Required:** Add ethical urgency:
  - "Limited spots available this month (12 remaining)"
  - "Price increases to $149 on Feb 1st"
  - "First 100 members get lifetime pricing lock"

### 7. **Unclear Value Proposition**
- **Current:** "Transform stress into strength"
- **Required:** Specific, measurable outcome:
  - "Reduce anxiety by 60% in 30 days (or your money back)"
  - "Stop panic attacks in 21 days with our proven system"
  - "Sleep through the night again—starting tonight"

### 8. **Missing "How It Works" Process Section**
- **Current:** Features listed, but no clear process
- **Required:** Simple 3-step process:
  1. **Book Your Call** - 15-min discovery call to assess your needs
  2. **Get Your Plan** - Personalized 30-day resilience roadmap
  3. **Transform** - Daily AI coaching + weekly check-ins = measurable results

### 9. **Weak CTA Optimization**
- **Current:** "Book Your Discovery Call" (good) and "Start Your Free Trial" (confusing - no trial mentioned)
- **Required:** Consistent, benefit-driven CTAs:
  - Primary: "Book Your Free Discovery Call" (emphasize FREE)
  - Secondary: "See Pricing & Plans"
  - Eliminate "Start Your Free Trial" unless offering actual trial

### 10. **Missing Comparison/Alternatives Section**
- **Current:** No competitive positioning
- **Required:** "Why Choose Us Over Traditional Therapy?" section:
  - **Traditional Therapy:** $200/session, 6-month wait, weekly appointments
  - **Purposeful Live:** $99-$299/month, start today, 24/7 AI support
  - **DIY Apps:** No human support, generic advice, high dropout rate
  - **Purposeful Live:** Certified coaches + AI, personalized plans, proven results
