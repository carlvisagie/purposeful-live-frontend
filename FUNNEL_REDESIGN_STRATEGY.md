## Cognitive Load Elimination

### Remove These Confusions:
1. ❌ Separate landing pages (enterprise vs. individual) → ✅ One unified page with clear options
2. ❌ Unclear product differences → ✅ Simple decision tree (AI vs. Human vs. Enterprise)
3. ❌ Too many CTAs → ✅ One primary CTA, one secondary
4. ❌ Complex booking flow → ✅ Single-page booking with progressive disclosure
5. ❌ Mixing session types and subscriptions → ✅ Clear separation (subscriptions on landing, sessions in dashboard)

### Simplification Rules:
- **One value prop per section**
- **One CTA per section** (except final section with 2-3 options)
- **Scannable copy** (short paragraphs, bullets, white space)
- **Clear visual hierarchy** (biggest = most important)
- **No distractions** (remove anything that doesn't increase conversions)
