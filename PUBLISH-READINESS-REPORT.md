## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: Published Site is Outdated

### Current Published Site Problems

**URL:** https://purposelc-4hfqx8wg.manus.space/individual

**Major Issues:**
1. ❌ **ALL booking buttons redirect to login** - massive friction, kills conversions
2. ❌ **No pricing cards visible** - shows "Loading coaching options..." indefinitely
3. ❌ **Missing dual-CTA** - no one-time vs subscription choice
4. ❌ **Old Master Prompt structure** - missing Stakes, Process, Proof sections
5. ❌ **No perpetual scarcity** - may show 0 spots
6. ❌ **No confirmation dialog** - no "What Happens Next" messaging

**Conversion Impact:** CATASTROPHIC - Users cannot book sessions without logging in first
