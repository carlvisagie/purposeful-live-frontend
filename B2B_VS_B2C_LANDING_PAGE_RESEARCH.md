# B2B vs B2C Landing Page Strategy Research

## Research Question
Should Purposeful Live Coaching combine enterprise (B2B) and individual (B2C) pricing on the same landing page, or create separate pages?

## Key Findings

### 1. Fundamental Differences Between B2B and B2C Landing Pages

**B2B Characteristics:**
- Longer decision-making process involving multiple stakeholders
- Focus on ROI, long-term benefits, and cost savings
- Require comprehensive information and detailed specifications
- Professional, authoritative tone
- Case studies, testimonials from reputable companies
- CTAs: "Request a Demo", "Schedule a Consultation", "Download Whitepaper"

**B2C Characteristics:**
- Quicker, emotionally-driven decisions
- Focus on immediate benefits and personal satisfaction
- Simple, concise messaging
- Conversational, relatable tone
- Customer reviews, ratings, user-generated content
- CTAs: "Buy Now", "Add to Cart", "Get Started"

### 2. Enterprise Pricing Best Practices

According to "Price to Scale" (SaaS pricing book used by Zoom, DocuSign, Twilio):

**❌ DO NOT create static enterprise pricing pages because:**
- Enterprise customers require flexibility and customization that can't be communicated on static pages
- They need specific Enterprise License Agreements, tailored discounting, and flexible product entitlements
- Complex needs are best discussed in personalized sales conversations
- Many truly enterprise-focused companies opt out of public pricing pages for enterprise solutions

**✅ RECOMMENDED APPROACH:**
- Handle enterprise pricing through sales team
- Use consultative approach for enterprise inquiries
- Reserve static pricing pages for commercial/individual customers who benefit from quick, transparent pricing

### 3. Conversion Rate Data

**B2B vs B2C Performance:**
- B2B landing pages average **13.3% conversion rate**
- B2C landing pages average **9.9% conversion rate**
- B2B outperforms B2C by **34%**

**Why the difference:**
- B2B visitors are more qualified and have higher intent
- B2C visitors are more casual browsers
- Mixing both audiences on same page dilutes messaging and reduces conversion for both

### 4. User Psychology: Mixing Enterprise and Individual Pricing

**Negative Impacts of Combining:**

**For Enterprise Buyers:**
- Seeing low individual pricing ($99-$299/month) makes them question the platform's enterprise capabilities
- Creates perception of "consumer-grade" product not suitable for organizations
- Reduces credibility and authority positioning
- Enterprise buyers expect exclusive, high-touch experience

**For Individual Buyers:**
- Seeing high enterprise pricing ($2,500-$7,500/month) creates sticker shock
- Makes them feel the product is "not for them"
- Creates confusion about which tier they should choose
- Reduces immediate purchase decisions

### 5. Industry Best Practices

**Separate Landing Pages Strategy (RECOMMENDED):**

**Examples:**
- Slack: slack.com (B2C) vs slack.com/enterprise (B2B)
- Zoom: zoom.us (B2C) vs zoom.us/enterprise (B2B)
- Dropbox: dropbox.com (B2C) vs dropbox.com/business (B2B)
- HubSpot: hubspot.com (B2C) vs hubspot.com/enterprise (B2B)

**Benefits:**
- Tailored messaging for each audience
- Optimized conversion funnels
- Clear positioning and value proposition
- No confusion or cognitive load
- Higher conversion rates for both segments

### 6. Navigation Strategy

**Best Practice:**
- Main homepage targets primary audience (usually B2C for faster revenue)
- Top navigation includes "For Business" or "Enterprise" link
- Footer includes "Enterprise Solutions" link
- No mixing of pricing tiers on same page
