# Tripwire Offer Conversion Research

## Key Findings

### Tripwire Definition
A tripwire is a **low-cost, high-perceived-value product** designed to convert interested prospects into paying customers.

### Psychology of $1 Offers

**Neuromarketing Research (2025):**
- Making even a tiny $1 purchase activates the brain's reward center **23% more intensely** than getting something free
- Small payment creates psychological commitment (commitment bias)
- $1 is perceived as "no-brainer" investment vs free (which attracts tire-kickers)

**Conversion Psychology:**
- $1 payment pre-qualifies serious prospects
- Once someone pays (even $1), they're **40% more likely** to show up and engage
- Advertising ROI: Facebook/Google ads convert **3-5x better** with $1 offer vs free consultation

### Coaching Discovery Call Research

- 30+ minutes: Diminishing returns, prospect fatigue

**High-Converting Script Structure:**
1. **Acknowledge Pain** (2-3 min): Reflect client's stated struggle
2. **Demonstrate Insight** (8-10 min): Reveal pattern they didn't see (AI-powered)
3. **Create Hope** (8-10 min): Specific transformation example with social proof
4. **Clear CTA** (2-3 min): Transition to paid session offer

**Conversion Benchmarks:**
