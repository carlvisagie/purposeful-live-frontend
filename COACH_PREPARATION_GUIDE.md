## Executive Summary

This guide establishes the foundational standards for all coaches operating within the Purposeful Live Coaching platform. It integrates evidence-based coaching practices, therapeutic communication principles, and comprehensive legal protections to create a system that prioritizes client wellbeing, coach professionalism, and organizational integrity.

The framework is built on three core pillars:

1. **Professional Excellence** — How to present, conduct yourself, and maintain the highest standards of coaching practice
2. **Ethical Integrity** — How to navigate complex situations with transparency, respect, and accountability
3. **Legal Protection** — How to structure your coaching relationship to protect both clients and yourself

---

## Part 1: Professional Presentation & Conduct Standards

### 1.1 Professional Appearance & Presence

Your physical presentation is the first signal of professionalism and trustworthiness. Research in therapeutic relationships demonstrates that client perception of coach credibility is significantly influenced by appearance, demeanor, and environmental cues [1].

**For Video Sessions (Primary Coaching Medium):**

- **Attire:** Business casual minimum. Wear clothing that is clean, well-fitted, and appropriate for a professional consultation. Avoid graphic t-shirts, athletic wear, or anything that might distract from the coaching conversation. Choose neutral colors (blues, grays, blacks, whites) that photograph well on camera.

- **Background:** Ensure your background is professional, uncluttered, and consistent. A bookshelf, professional office, or neutral wall is ideal. Avoid bedrooms, kitchens, or chaotic spaces. Poor backgrounds signal lack of professionalism and can undermine client trust.

- **Lighting:** Position yourself so your face is well-lit and clearly visible. Avoid backlighting or shadows. Natural light from a window is ideal; supplement with a desk lamp if needed.

- **Camera & Audio:** Use a high-quality webcam and microphone. Poor audio quality is one of the fastest ways to lose client confidence. Test your setup before every session.

- **Grooming:** Be well-groomed. Hair should be neat, facial hair trimmed, and nails clean. This is not about vanity—it signals respect for the client and the coaching relationship.

**For In-Person Sessions:**

- **Attire:** Business casual to business formal. A blazer, professional dress pants or skirt, and closed-toe shoes are standard. Avoid anything that could be perceived as casual or intimate.

- **Personal Hygiene:** Impeccable. Shower before sessions, use deodorant, avoid strong perfumes or colognes that might trigger sensitivities.

- **Jewelry & Accessories:** Keep minimal and professional. Avoid anything that jingles, dangles, or draws attention away from the coaching conversation.

- **Office Environment:** Your coaching space should feel safe, professional, and confidential. Comfortable seating, good lighting, minimal distractions, and clear confidentiality boundaries are essential.

### 1.2 Verbal & Non-Verbal Communication Standards

Your communication style sets the emotional tone for the entire coaching relationship. Therapeutic communication research identifies specific techniques that build trust and psychological safety [2].

**Verbal Communication Principles:**

- **Speak clearly and deliberately.** Avoid filler words like "um," "uh," "like," or "you know." These undermine credibility and distract from your message.

- **Use a calm, measured tone.** Your voice should convey confidence without arrogance, warmth without familiarity, and professionalism without coldness.

- **Avoid jargon unless the client introduces it first.** Coaching language should be accessible. If you use technical terms, explain them clearly.

- **Listen more than you speak.** The coaching relationship is client-centered. Your role is to ask powerful questions and listen deeply, not to dominate the conversation.

- **Validate before challenging.** When you need to offer a different perspective, first acknowledge the client's current viewpoint. This builds trust and makes clients more receptive to new ideas.

**Non-Verbal Communication Standards:**

- **Maintain appropriate eye contact.** In video coaching, look at the camera when speaking to simulate direct eye contact. During in-person sessions, maintain steady eye contact without staring.

- **Use open body language.** Avoid crossing your arms, turning away, or creating physical barriers. Lean slightly forward to show engagement and interest.

- **Match the client's energy appropriately.** If a client is grieving, your energy should be calm and contemplative. If they're excited about a breakthrough, your energy should reflect their positive momentum.

- **Use purposeful gestures.** Hand movements should emphasize your points, not distract. Avoid fidgeting, tapping, or repetitive movements.

- **Respect physical boundaries.** In in-person sessions, maintain appropriate distance (3-4 feet). Never touch a client without explicit permission.

### 1.3 Punctuality & Session Management

Professionalism includes respecting the client's time as much as your own.

- **Log in 5 minutes early.** Test your technology, review your notes, and prepare mentally for the session.

- **Start and end on time.** If a session is scheduled for 50 minutes, deliver 50 minutes of coaching. Not 45 minutes. Not 55 minutes.

- **Manage transitions professionally.** Have a clear closing ritual that signals the session is ending. Summarize key insights, confirm next steps, and thank the client for their time.

- **Follow up within 24 hours.** Send a brief email summarizing the session, any action items, and your observations. This reinforces learning and demonstrates professionalism.

### 1.4 Confidentiality & Boundaries

Confidentiality is the foundation of the coaching relationship. Without it, clients cannot be vulnerable, and transformation cannot occur.

**Confidentiality Standards:**

- **What you hear in coaching stays in coaching.** Do not discuss client information with anyone—colleagues, friends, family, or other clients—without explicit written consent.

- **Secure all client information.** Use password-protected devices, encrypted communication, and secure storage. Never leave client notes visible or accessible to others.

- **Understand mandatory reporting requirements.** In most jurisdictions, coaches are required to report imminent danger to self or others, child abuse, and elder abuse. Know your local legal requirements and communicate these limits to clients at the outset.

- **Be transparent about exceptions.** In your initial session, clearly state: "Everything you share with me is confidential, with three exceptions: if you indicate you're going to harm yourself, if you indicate you're going to harm someone else, or if you disclose child abuse. In those cases, I'm legally required to report."

**Professional Boundaries:**

- **Do not become friends with clients.** Coaching relationships have a power dynamic. Friendship blurs this dynamic and compromises your objectivity.

- **Do not provide coaching to family members or close friends.** The existing relationship will interfere with the coaching process.

- **Do not engage in dual relationships.** You cannot be someone's coach and their therapist, business consultant, and financial advisor simultaneously. Stick to coaching.

- **Do not accept gifts beyond nominal value.** A small thank-you gift is fine. An expensive gift creates obligation and blurs boundaries.

- **Do not extend sessions beyond the agreed time.** If a client needs more time, schedule another session. Extending sessions creates unsustainable patterns and blurs boundaries.

## Part 2: Therapeutic Language Framework

Language is the primary tool of coaching. The words you choose either build trust or erode it. They either empower clients or diminish them. They either create safety or trigger defensiveness.

### 2.1 Core Principles of Therapeutic Language

**Principle 1: Assume Positive Intent**

The client is not broken. They are not deficient. They are capable, resourceful, and whole. Your language should reflect this belief. Instead of "You have a problem with procrastination," say "You're exploring how to move forward on your goals more consistently."

**Principle 2: Use Empowering Language**

Avoid language that suggests the client is a victim or powerless. Instead of "You can't seem to get out of this situation," say "You're working on finding new ways to approach this situation." The first suggests helplessness. The second suggests agency.

**Principle 3: Normalize, Don't Pathologize**

Most client struggles are normal human experiences, not pathology. Anxiety about change is normal. Resistance to growth is normal. Doubt is normal. Your language should normalize these experiences rather than treating them as problems to be fixed.

Instead of: "You're struggling with anxiety."  
Say: "You're experiencing some anxiety as you consider this change, which is a natural part of the growth process."

**Principle 4: Use Possibility Language**

Coaching is about possibility. Your language should open doors, not close them. Replace "can't" with "haven't yet." Replace "impossible" with "not yet possible." Replace "I don't know" with "I'm curious about..."

**Principle 5: Avoid Triggering Language**

Certain words trigger defensive or emotional responses. Be mindful of language that might activate trauma, shame, or defensiveness. For example:

- Avoid "should" (creates guilt and shame). Use "you might consider" or "what if you..."
- Avoid "but" (negates what came before). Use "and" instead.
- Avoid "try" (suggests half-hearted effort). Use "commit to" or "experiment with."
- Avoid "problem" (pathologizes). Use "challenge," "opportunity," or "area of focus."
- Avoid "failure" (creates shame). Use "learning," "experiment," or "iteration."

### 2.2 Therapeutic Communication Techniques

**Active Listening:**

Active listening is not just hearing words. It's understanding the emotion, intention, and meaning behind the words. It requires your full presence and attention.

- **Listen without planning your response.** Don't think about what you'll say next while the client is talking.
- **Listen for what's not being said.** Pay attention to tone, pace, and energy shifts. These often reveal what the client is not directly expressing.
- **Reflect back what you hear.** "What I'm hearing is... Is that accurate?" This confirms understanding and shows the client you're truly listening.
- **Validate the emotion.** "That sounds frustrating" or "I can see why that would feel overwhelming." Validation doesn't mean agreement; it means acknowledging the client's emotional experience as real and legitimate.

**Powerful Questions:**

Questions are the primary tool of coaching. They invite reflection, expand perspective, and catalyze insight. Powerful questions are:

- **Open-ended.** "What are you noticing?" not "Are you feeling better?"
- **Curious, not leading.** "What's your sense of what's happening?" not "Don't you think you should...?"
- **Focused on possibility.** "What would be possible if you approached this differently?" not "Why can't you just do this?"
- **Grounded in the client's experience.** "What does success look like for you?" not "What does success look like in general?"

**Reframing:**

Reframing is offering a different perspective on a situation without negating the client's current perspective. It's not about positive thinking or toxic optimism. It's about expanding the frame.

Client: "I'm stuck. I've tried everything and nothing works."

Coach (reframe): "You've tried many approaches and learned what doesn't work. That's valuable information. What might you learn from what hasn't worked?"

This reframe doesn't deny the client's frustration. It shifts the frame from "I'm stuck" to "I'm learning."

**Validation + Challenge:**

The most effective coaching holds both validation and challenge. Validate the client's current experience, then invite them to consider a different possibility.

"I hear that you're feeling overwhelmed by all the changes happening at once. That makes complete sense. I'm also curious—if you had to identify just one area to focus on first, where would that be?"

This validates the overwhelm while gently challenging the client to narrow focus.

### 2.3 Language to Avoid

**Avoid Prescriptive Language:**

"You should..." "You need to..." "You have to..." These phrases position you as the expert and the client as someone who needs to be fixed. Coaching is collaborative, not prescriptive.

Instead: "What do you think might happen if you...?" "Have you considered...?" "What feels right to you?"

**Avoid Judgment Language:**

"That's a good/bad decision." "You're being unrealistic." "That's not a healthy way to think." Judgment closes the coaching relationship. It makes clients defensive and less likely to be vulnerable.

Instead: "What's your thinking behind that choice?" "I'm curious about your perspective." "Tell me more about how you arrived at that conclusion."

**Avoid Comparative Language:**

"Other clients I work with..." "Most people would..." "You're not like other people who..." Comparison creates shame and undermines the client's unique journey.

Instead: "I'm curious about your experience." "What matters to you in this situation?" "How does this align with your values?"

**Avoid Absolutes:**

"You always..." "You never..." "This will always..." Absolutes are rarely true and create defensiveness. They also limit possibility.

Instead: "I'm noticing a pattern..." "In this situation..." "What I'm observing is..."

### 2.4 Culturally Responsive Language

Coaching clients come from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. Your language should honor this diversity.

- **Ask about cultural context.** "Can you tell me about your cultural background and how it shapes your perspective on this?" This shows respect and gathers important information.

- **Avoid cultural assumptions.** Don't assume family structures, values, or communication styles. Ask and listen.

- **Use inclusive language.** "Partner," "spouse," or "significant other" instead of assuming gender or marital status. "They/them" pronouns if you're unsure of someone's gender identity.

- **Be aware of language barriers.** If English is not the client's first language, speak clearly, use simpler sentence structures, and check for understanding frequently.

- **Recognize power dynamics.** Be aware of how your identity (race, gender, class, ability, etc.) might influence the coaching relationship. Acknowledge it if it's relevant.

## Part 3: Legal Protection & Client Safety Protocols

### 3.1 Essential Disclaimers & Scope of Practice

Coaching is not therapy, counseling, medical advice, or legal advice. Your role is to help clients clarify their goals, identify obstacles, and create action plans. Everything outside this scope requires referral to a qualified professional.

**Required Disclaimer (to be included in all client agreements):**

> **Coaching Disclaimer:** Coaching is a professional relationship designed to help you clarify goals, identify obstacles, and develop action plans for personal or professional growth. Coaching is not therapy, counseling, medical advice, psychiatric treatment, or legal advice. If you are experiencing mental health concerns, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, or other conditions requiring professional treatment, please consult a licensed mental health professional. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call emergency services immediately. Purposeful Live Coaching does not diagnose, treat, or cure any medical or psychological condition.

**Scope of Practice Statement (to be reviewed with every client):**

"My role as your coach is to help you identify your goals, explore what's getting in your way, and develop strategies to move forward. I'm trained in coaching, not therapy or counseling. If at any point you feel you need mental health support, I'll refer you to a qualified professional. My job is to support your growth within the coaching framework, not to treat psychological or medical conditions."

### 3.2 Mandatory Reporting & Crisis Protocols

In most jurisdictions, coaches are required to report imminent danger to self or others, child abuse, and elder abuse. Know your local legal requirements and communicate these clearly to clients.

**Crisis Protocol:**

If a client indicates imminent danger to themselves or others:

1. **Take it seriously.** Do not minimize or dismiss the statement.

2. **Ask directly.** "Are you saying you're thinking about harming yourself right now?" Get clarity on the level of danger and whether there's a plan.

3. **Do not leave them alone.** If you're in a video session, stay on the call. If in-person, do not leave them unattended.

4. **Contact emergency services.** Call 911 (or your local emergency number) and provide the client's location and information about the danger.

5. **Notify the platform.** Contact Purposeful Live Coaching immediately with details of the situation.

6. **Document everything.** Write down exactly what the client said, your response, and what actions you took. This documentation protects both you and the client.

**Mandatory Reporting Statement (to be included in client agreement):**

> **Mandatory Reporting:** I am required by law to report imminent danger to yourself or others, child abuse, and elder abuse. If you disclose any of these situations, I will be obligated to report to the appropriate authorities. This is not a violation of confidentiality—it's a legal requirement to protect safety.

### 3.3 Client Screening & Intake Process

Not every person is appropriate for coaching. Some clients need therapy, medical treatment, or other professional services. Your intake process should screen for these situations.

**Intake Questions:**

- "What brings you to coaching right now?"
- "What are you hoping to achieve?"
- "Are you currently working with a therapist or counselor?"
- "Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental health condition?"
- "Are you currently taking any medications for mental health?"
- "Have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or others?"
- "Is there anything else I should know about your situation?"

**Red Flags for Referral:**

If a client indicates any of the following, refer them to a mental health professional before proceeding with coaching:

- Active suicidal or homicidal ideation
- Untreated mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, etc.)
- Active substance abuse
- Severe trauma without professional support
- Psychosis or delusions
- Severe personality disorders affecting functioning

**Referral Script:**

"Based on what you've shared, I think it would be beneficial for you to work with a therapist or counselor first. Coaching works best when you have a stable foundation of mental health support. I'd like to refer you to [specific professional/resource]. Once you've worked with them for a while, coaching could be a great complement to that work. Does that feel right to you?"

### 3.4 Client Agreement & Informed Consent

Every coaching relationship must begin with a clear, written agreement that the client signs. This agreement protects both you and the client by establishing expectations, boundaries, and limitations.

**Essential Elements of a Coaching Agreement:**

1. **Definition of Coaching** — What coaching is and what it is not
2. **Scope of Services** — What you will and will not do
3. **Client Responsibilities** — What the client is responsible for
4. **Confidentiality** — What is confidential and what is not
5. **Fees & Payment** — Cost, payment terms, cancellation policy
6. **Disclaimers** — Coaching is not therapy, medical advice, etc.
7. **Mandatory Reporting** — When you're required to break confidentiality
8. **Termination** — How either party can end the relationship
9. **Liability Waiver** — Limits on your liability

### 3.5 Insurance & Legal Protection

**Get Liability Insurance:**

Professional liability insurance (also called errors and omissions insurance) protects you if a client sues. It's not expensive (typically $200-500/year) and is essential protection.

**Maintain Detailed Records:**

Keep notes on every session including:
- Date and time of session
- Topics discussed
- Client's stated goals and progress
- Any concerning statements or red flags
- Referrals made
- Client's response to coaching

These records protect you if there's ever a dispute or legal issue.

**Have a Legal Review:**

Have a lawyer review your coaching agreement, disclaimers, and policies. This is a one-time investment that provides significant protection.

**Know Your Local Laws:**

Coaching regulations vary by location. Some places require licensing; others don't. Know what applies in your jurisdiction and comply fully.
